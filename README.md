# Lightbulb Learning


ðŸ’¡  Some people just want to see the world learn. We believe: That works best in a friendly, collaborative environment without pressure. That is why Lightbulb Learning is about growth through	understanding instead of grades through memorization.

ðŸ¥‹  Lightbulb Learning is a dialogue platform: it lets your students challenge each other by asking good open questions, answering them precisely and providing feedback for each others work - all of that being a part of their educational process and performance.

ðŸ“ˆ  Observe and evaluate your students path through the learning curve over weeks or months, because growth takes more time than a 90 minute exam.

ðŸ”¥  It is all free and open source. [Get your hands on Lightbulb Learning to learn more.](https://lightbulb-learning.io)
