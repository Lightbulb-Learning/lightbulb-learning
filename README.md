# ðŸ’¡ lightbulb learning

Hi!

I am working on a tool to scale exams indefinitely by moving them to the online world.

The crux: the questions are provided by the students themselves and doing so is part of the exam.

It is open source and will be provided as hosted service later on.

I would be glad to add you to the lightbulb learning [mailing list](https://tinyletter.com/RobertNickel), where I share updates, success stories, fails and lessons learned.

lightbulb learning - learning for the long run
