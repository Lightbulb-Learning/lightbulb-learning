<p class="principle">
	ðŸ’¡&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people just want to see the world learn. We believe: That works best in a friendly,
	collaborative environment without pressure. That is why Lightbulb Learning is about growth through
	understanding instead of grades through memorization.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ¥‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightbulb Learning lets your students challenge each other by asking good open questions,
	answering them precisely and providing feedback for each others work - all of that being a part of their
	educational process and performance.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ“ˆ&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe and evaluate your students path through the learning curve over weeks or months,
	because growth takes more time than a 90 minute exam.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ”¥&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying Lightbulb Learning with your friends or students. It is all free and open source.
