    ðŸ’¡&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vision is to optimize for learning itself - because
    the demands to the graduates of the future are different from those of the
    past. They need to communicate, collaborate, analyze complex problems and
    develop solutions in teams. Using access to the internet and knowing how to
    filter the gigantic amount of information means being able to find solutions
    for the problems of the future.

    asking good question, answering them precisely and providing feedback for
