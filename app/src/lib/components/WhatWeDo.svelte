<p class="principle">
	ðŸ’¡&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe: Learning works best in a friendly, collaborative environment without pressure.
	That is why Lightbulb Learning is about growth through understanding instead of grades through memorization.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ¥‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightbulb Learning lets your students challenge each other by asking good open questions,
	answering them precisely and providing feedback for each others work - all of that being a part of their
	educational performance.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ“ˆ&nbsp;&nbsp;See all aspects of performance of each student in chronological order over weeks or months, because growth takes more time
	than a 90 minute exam.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	ðŸ”¥&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying Lightbulb Learning with your friends or students. It is all free and open source.
